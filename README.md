# RSA-ALGORITHM
The RSA algorithm is a widely used asymmetric (public-key) encryption and digital signature algorithm in modern cryptography.
RSA is known for its security and versatility, making it suitable for a wide range of cryptographic applications, including secure communication and digital signatures. 
This is a simple RSA algorithm suitable for numeric messages only.
RSA is a foundational encryption algorithm, but its security depends on proper key management and key size selection.
Larger key sizes are recommended for stronger security, especially in today's computing environment where increasing computational power makes it easier to perform attacks on smaller key sizes.
